Redditate
=================

Redditate is a simple Reddit reader that aims to make the browsing experience more pleasurable and easier for newbies :)


Why am I making it?
-----

I effin love browsing Reddit, but I wish I had a way to browse it that was a bit more friendly and beautiful. Reddit's design is functional, but I wanted to strip it down and make it my own. I've been noodling in my free time after everyone else is asleep, so don't expect rapid progress.

Install Dependencies
-----
Grab yourself a copy of [bower](http://bower.io) to install the dependencies: ```npm install -g bower```. Install the dependencies with ```bower install```


Want to use it yourself?
-----

Just go to [www.redditate.com](http://www.redditate.com). Are you a super nerd who wants their own copy?! Download the codebase here on Github, install dependencies as above, and open the index.html file and enjoy (no server needed).


What works right now?
-----

+ Browsing the front page or any subreddit - click the dropdown in the fixed header
+ Using fullview and listview - cookies your preference
+ Inline imgur and youtube - click them to play or zoom in
+ Click images to see max-size inline
+ Keyboard navigation
+ Endless scrolling
+ Check it out on any device (responsive media query goodness)


What's coming next?
-----------

Honestly not sure just yet. Going to wait to see what everyone thinks and go from there!
